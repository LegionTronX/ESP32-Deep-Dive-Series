Introduction to ADC on ESP32

Welcome to the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) section of our ESP32 project. An ADC is crucial for microcontrollers like the ESP32 to interpret analog signals—such as those from sensors measuring light, temperature, or pressure—and convert them into digital format for processing.

In today's technology, ADCs are vital in applications that enable devices to interact with the physical world. From environmental monitoring systems to digital audio converters, ADCs bridge the gap between analog inputs and digital processing capabilities.

This README provides an overview of the ESP32's ADC features, showcasing how to leverage this functionality in various applications through detailed examples and technical documentation. Here, you'll find everything from basic setup instructions to in-depth exploration of ADC capabilities. **As a practical example, we will demonstrate how to use an ADC to read inputs from a potentiometer, which varies resistance based on turning angle, and convert these analog signals to digital format to interpret changes in angle or position.** https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/adc.html
