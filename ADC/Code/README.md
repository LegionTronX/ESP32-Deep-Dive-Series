**Code Explanation for ADC to PWM Servo Control**

**Introduction**

Let's break down the code to understand each part and its function:

**Including Libraries and Definitions:**

You've included standard and ESP-IDF specific libraries necessary for handling ADC readings, PWM output, and system logging.

**Defining Constants:**

Constants like MAX_ADC_VALUE and MAX_PWM_VALUE represent the highest resolution for ADC and PWM, which will be used in scaling sensor input to PWM output.

**ADC Configuration:**

adc1_config_width(ADC_WIDTH_BIT_12):

Sets ADC resolution to 12 bits, allowing a range from 0 to 4095.

**adc1_config_channel_atten(POTENTIOMETER_ADC_CHANNEL, ADC_ATTEN_DB_11):**

Adjusts the attenuation for the ADC channel to 11 dB, enabling the measurement of larger voltage spans.

**ADC Calibration:**

Initializes calibration characteristics for the ADC to enhance accuracy, crucial for precision-required applications.

**PWM Setup:**

Configures a PWM timer and channel for controlling a servo motor, specifying frequency and resolution to ensure smooth operation.

**Main Application Loop:**

Continuously reads the potentiometer's analog value and converts it into a PWM signal to adjust the servo's position. Uses ledc_set_duty and ledc_update_duty functions to apply the PWM value, including periodic logging for debugging purposes.
