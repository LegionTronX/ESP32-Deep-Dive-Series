Let's break down your code to understand each part and its function:

Including Libraries and Definitions:
You've included standard and ESP-IDF specific libraries necessary for handling ADC readings, PWM output, and system logging.
Constants defined like MAX_ADC_VALUE and MAX_PWM_VALUE represent the highest resolution for ADC and PWM, which will be used in scaling sensor input to PWM output.
Setup of ADC:
adc1_config_width(ADC_WIDTH_BIT_12): Configures ADC resolution to 12 bits, which allows a range from 0 to 4095.
adc1_config_channel_atten(POTENTIOMETER_ADC_CHANNEL, ADC_ATTEN_DB_11): Sets the attenuation for the ADC channel to 11 dB, allowing you to measure larger voltage spans.
ADC Calibration:
Initializes calibration characteristics for the ADC to improve accuracy. This is crucial for applications where precise measurements are needed.
Setup of PWM:
Configures a PWM timer and channel for controlling a servo motor. The timer setup specifies the frequency and resolution, which are important for determining how smoothly the servo can move.
Main Application Loop:
Continuously reads the potentiometer's analog value and converts it into a PWM signal to adjust the servo's position.
The ledc_set_duty and ledc_update_duty functions are used to apply the PWM value to the servo.
Includes periodic logging of the potentiometer and PWM values for debugging purposes.
